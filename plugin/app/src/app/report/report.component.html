			Someone else may have already reported your request. Did you check?
			<ul>
				<li>The <a href="https://github.com/thomaschampagne/stravistix/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions"
						   target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions</a>?
				</li>
				<li>The <a
					href="https://github.com/thomaschampagne/stravistix/issues"
					target="_blank">existing issues or features requests on GitHub</a>?
				</li>
			</ul>

		<div>
			I'm alone having this problem or request. Where can i report?
		</div>
		<div>
			StravistiX is an open-source project having sources hosted on GitHub. All features, bugs, and
			open-source contributions are managed from the <a href="https://github.com/thomaschampagne/stravistix/"
															  target="_blank">project repository</a>.
		</div>
		<div>
			So ideally, please submit your bug or request <a
			href="https://github.com/thomaschampagne/stravistix/issues/new" target="_blank">here</a> to insert them in
			the dedicated development workflow.
		</div>
		<div>
			You may don't want to create a github account?!
		</div>
		<div>
			This is understandable. Even if not recommend, because out of workflow, you can submit your request from <a
			href="#" target="_blank">this google form (to be done)</a>.
