		From now, heart rate based activities have their stress scores processed with <strong><i>Heart Rate Stress Score
		(HRSS)</i></strong> method. They were previously processed using the <strong><i>Training Impulse
		(TRIMP)</i></strong> method only.<br/><br/>

		The <i>HRSS</i> method is recommended over <i>TRIMP</i> because:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>HRSS</i> scores are scaled to be use with <i>Training Zones</i>. <i>TRIMP</i> had a scale missmatch
				with <i>Training Zones</i>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>HRSS</i> scores can be directly compared to <i>Cycling Power Stress Scores (PSS)</i>. They use same
				referential or scale.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>HRSS</i> scores can be directly compared to <i>Swimming Stress Scores (SSS)</i>. They also use same
				referential or scale.
			</li>
		</ul>

		With this change your <i>HRSS</i> scores will be ~40-30% lower than <i>TRIMP</i> scores. Fitness and fatigue
		values will also drop in the same time. <strong>It's an expected and normal behaviour</strong>. Basically
		just think that <i>TRIMP</i> scores
		are on "another scale" and <i>HRSS</i> scores are on the scale to be compared with training zones and others
		<i>PSS</i> and <i>SSS</i> scores.
		And like <i>TRIMP</i>, <i>HRSS</i> also depends on exercise duration and intensity and provides a good
		indicator to compare commitment between activities.

		You should <strong>setup your own <i>Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR)</i></strong> in <a
		routerLink="/athleteSettings">athlete settings</a>
		for best results. (<i>LTHR</i> is basically the latest best average heart rate you can maintain for up to an
		hour.)
	</div>
	<div>
		However you can still enable back <i>TRIMP</i> as default heart rate stress score calculation method in the
		feature settings by clicking the
