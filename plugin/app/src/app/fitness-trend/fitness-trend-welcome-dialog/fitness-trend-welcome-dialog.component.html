		From now, heart rate based activities have their stress scores processed with <strong><i>Heart Rate Stress Score
		(HRSS)</i></strong> method. They were previously processed using the <strong><i>Training Impulse
		(TRIMP)</i></strong> method only.<br/><br/>

		The <i>HRSS</i> method has been added over <i>TRIMP</i> because:

		<ul>
			<li>
				<i>HRSS</i> scores are scaled to be use with <i>Training Zones</i>. <i>TRIMP</i> had a scale missmatch
				with <i>Training Zones</i>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>HRSS</i> scores can be directly compared to <i>Cycling Power Stress Scores (PSS)</i>. They use same
				referential or scale.
			</li>
			<li>
				<i>HRSS</i> scores can be directly compared to <i>Swimming Stress Scores (SSS)</i>. They also use same
				referential or scale.
			</li>
		</ul>

		However you can still enable back <i>TRIMP</i> as default heart rate stress score calculation
		method in the feature settings by clicking the

		icon.<br/>

		A new fitness trend guide is accessible from
		<mat-icon color="primary">help_outline</mat-icon>
		icon. Reading this guide is strongly recommended too.
