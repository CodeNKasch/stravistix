		From now, heart rate based activities have their stress scores processed with Heart Rate Stress Score (HRSS)
		method.
		Previously they were calculated using Training Impulse (TRIMP) method.<br/><br/>
		Using HRSS over TRIMP is profitable because it allows direct comparison with others stress scores such as
		cycling
		Power Stress Score (PSS) & Swiming Stress Score (SSS) and a right use of the training zones (overload, optimal,
		neutral, freshness...).<br/><br/>
		In previous version, you were able to use training zones with TRIMPS scored activities: the
		interpretation of the zones were clearly less accurate...
